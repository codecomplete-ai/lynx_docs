## Local Agent Downloading 

WIP

## Usage
Run the downloaded program `./lynx.bin` before starting any investigation.

## Authentication
1. Navigate to Setting > to create Lynx private key.
2. Store `LYNX_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and `LYNX_SECRET_ACCESS_ID` to `~/lynx/credentials` file.


### Lynx Config
When you first connect Lynx to your environment, Lynx will automatically generate a config file at `~/.lynx/config` with details about your environment, including OS name and version, CLI tools, and more. 

You can edit this config file directly on your machine to further customize your Lynx experience.

We recommend specifying an absolute path to your codebase in your lynxconfig file or user instructions to help Lynx find your codebase.

Example config:
```yaml
## Lynx Generated Keys
## Do not edit
os_name=Ubuntu
os_version=22.04.5 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)
aws_cli_version=aws-cli/2.22.12

## User Generated Keys
## Add values here
codebase_dir=/home/ubuntu/myapp
```
