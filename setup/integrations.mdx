## Cloud Provider Integrations
Lynx integrates with cloud providers to enable secure command execution during incident investigations. Currently supported:
- AWS (Public Beta)
- GCP and Azure (Contact Lynx representative for access)

### AWS Integration

#### Organization Setup
Prerequisites
- AWS IAM permissions for role creation
- Lynx Organization Admin access

Steps

1. Create an IAM role in your AWS account using the trust policy below.
2. Navigate to Settings > Organization Settings in Lynx
3. Enable AWS Integration and enter your Role ARN

We provide a setup [script](/setup/provision_ssm_iam_script) to automate the IAM role creation process.

##### Instance Requirements
- EC2 instances must have an IAM instance profile with the `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore` [policy](/setup/ssm_policy)
- Systems Manager (SSM) agent must be [installed and running](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/manually-install-ssm-agent-linux.html)

2. Configure AWS Instance Profile:
   - AWS Instance ID (e.g. i-01234567890abcdef0)
   - AWS Region (e.g. us-east-1)
   - Username (output of `whoami`)
3. Click "Submit"
