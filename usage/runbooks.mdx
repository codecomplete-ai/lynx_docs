## Runbooks
Lynx runbooks are a way to automate your investigation process. You can create runbooks to automate your investigation process, and then execute them in investigations.

Runbooks are a series of steps that you can execute in an investigation. Each step is written in natural language and executed in chain of thought mode.

Create a runbook by clicking the `Create Runbook` button on the home page or from the `Runbooks` page.

Manage runbooks by opening the runbook from the `Runbooks` page and clicking the `View` button.

## Runbook Execution
You can directly execute a runbook in investigations.

To execute a runbook in a new investigation, click the `Open Investigation with Runbook` button on the new runbook page, and search for the runbook you want to execute.

To execute a runbook in an existing investigation, type `@runbook` in the chat input box and search for the runbook you want to execute.
